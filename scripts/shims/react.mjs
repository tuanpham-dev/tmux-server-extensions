// Build-time alias target for bare `import ... from "react"` in bundled
// extensions (see ../../build.mjs) — inlined into each extension's own
// dist/client.js, but every export here is the exact function/object
// reference from the host's already-loaded React instance
// (window.__tmuxServerModules, set in client/src/main.tsx before any
// extension can activate). A second real copy of React would have its own
// internal hook dispatcher and break under the host's ReactDOM; re-exporting
// the host's own references instead means there's still only one React at
// runtime no matter how many separate bundles reference "react".
